    This code gets all of the Student objects out of the students map as a collection by calling the values() method.  
    We pass that returned collection into the constructor for a new ArrayList.  
    One of the constructors for ArrayList take a collection as a parameter, which effectively allows us 
    to convert the collection of Student objects into an ArrayList of Student objects that we can return from the method.  
    Note that our method specifies that we’ll return a List<Student> but we create and return an ArrayList<Student>.  
    This is perfectly fine because ArrayList implements the List interface so it can be treated as a List.
